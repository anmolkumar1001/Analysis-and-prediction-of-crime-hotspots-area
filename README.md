# Analysis and Prediction of Crime Hotspots Area

Final year engineering group project developed using Stacked Generalization Machine Learning Approach.

_\_\_\_\_\*\*OBJECTIVES_\_\_\_\_\*\*

• Extraction of crime patterns by analysis of available crime and criminal data.

• Predict the crime rate and analyze the crime rate to be happened in future. Based on this information the officials can take charge and try to reduce the crime rate.

• Identify precise crime prone zones through crime analysis.

• Displaying the pictorial representation of crime hotspots.

• Facilitate and suggest surveillance plan and scheduling with respect to crime prone zones identified.

• The aim of this project is to perform analysis and prediction of crimes in states using machine learning models. It focuses on creating a model that can help to detect the number of crimes by its type in a particular state.

**_*DATASET*_**

We have taken 1000 enteries of Bangalore crime data.

_\_\_\_\_\*\*CONCLUSION_\_\_\_\_\*\*

Based on the analysis and prediction of crime hotspots using the stacked generalization approach with decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting machine learning algorithms, we can conclude that:

1. The stacked generalization approach combining the predictions of multiple models can improve the accuracy of crime hotspot prediction compared to using a single model.

2. Among the three machine learning algorithms used in this project, the decision tree algorithm performed the best in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.

3. The features that were found to be most important in predicting crime hotspots include location, latitude & longitude, weather, and previous crime incidents.

4. The results of this project can be useful in developing crime prevention strategies and allocating law enforcement resources more effectively.

Our project achieves _83%_ accuracy in predicting crime hotspots.
